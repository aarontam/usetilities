Utilities you'll actually use! Current utilities include:
- Git Switcher
- Git Brancher
- Git Tagger

Git Switcher
============
Easily switch multiple repositories to the same tag or branch. You can specify a number of repositories or use the default set that are Enyo-specific.

Git Brancher
============
Easily create the same branch on multiple repositories, based off a specified base branch. You can specify a set of specific repositories, or use the default set that are Enyo-specific. A "delete" option will soon be added to allow for a reversal of the branching action.

Git Tagger
==========
Easily create the same tag on multiple repositories, based off a specified branch/tag/hash. You can specify a set of specific repositories, or use the default set that are Enyo-specific. A "delete" option will soon be added to allow for a reversal of the branching action.
